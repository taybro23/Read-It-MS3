# Overview

Read-It is a site that is designed for people who are looking to keep a record of books that they have read, and share their reviews with others. 
Users are able to view books and reviews without needing to create an account. This allows new users to preview the site before registering so they have an idea of what the site is like. 
When a User decides to register, they will be able to log in with ease, create and manage their favourite books, and share them with other Users of the site.
